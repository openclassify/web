# Openclassify React Web

> üöß **This project is heavily under construction!** üöß As excited as you may be, we don't recommend this early alpha for production use. Still, give it a try if you want to have some fun and don't mind [logging bugs](https://github.com/openclassify/web/issues) along the way :)

[Openclassify](https://openclassify.com) is the simplest way to handle styles and component frameworks on your 11ty site. Once installed, this:

- üöÄ **Unlocks component frameworks** like React for writing page templates and layout templates. Turn an existing `.html` or `.liquid` file into a `.jsx` file, and you're off to the componentized races.
- üîñ **Includes powerful shortcodes** to insert components into existing pages. Add a line like this to your markdown, HTML, Nunjucks, etc, and watch the magic happen: `{% react 'path/to/component' %}`
- üíß **Hydrates these components** when and how you want. Use component frameworks as a static template to start, and opt-in to shipping JS as needed with our [partial hydration helpers](https://Openclassify.com/docs/).
- üíÖ **Bundles all your resources** with the power of React. Use your favorite CSS preprocessor, JS minifier, and more with minimal config.

## Technologies used

Openclassify stands on the shoulders of giants. You can think of Openclassify as the "glue" binding 2 tools together:

1. [**Laravel**](https://www.laravel.com) 
2. [**react Js**](https://reactjs.org)

## Getting started

Use our handy CLI command to spin up a Openclassify site: `npm init Openclassify`. This demos our core functionality while staying as lean as possible, making it the perfect launchpad for new projects üöÄ
